# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is reting resources on another company in a "pay only for what you use" model. The company provisioning these services is referred to as a Cloud Provider.

Typically, the computing services offered by a cloud provider are:
* **Compute power** - such as Linux servers or web applications, usually in the form of a *virtual machine*, a *container* or as *serverless computing*. You can have a VM, for instance, in minutes with the desired configuration at less cost than a physical computer.
* **Storage** - such as files and databases. The advantage to using cloud-based data storage is you can scale to meet your needs.
* **Networking** - secure connections
* **Analytics** - visualizing telemetry and performance data.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

* **It's cost effective**: Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model.
* **It's scalable**: You can increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time, doing both vertical and horizontal scaling depending on your needs.
    - *Vertical scaling* is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server (adding more CPUs or memory...).
    - *Horizontal scaling* is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit.
* **It's elastic**: As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can compensate by automatically adding or removing resources.
* **It's current**: The cloud provider handles all software patches, hardware setup, upgrades, and other IT management tasks to ensure you're using the latest and greatest tools to run your business.The computer hardware is also maintained and upgraded by the cloud provider.
* **It's reliable**: Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services to make sure your data is always safe. In addition, redundancy is often built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This is referred to as *fault tolerance*.
* **It's global**: Cloud providers have fully redundant datacenters located in various regions all over the globe, giving you a local presence close to your customers to give them the best response time possible. You can replicate your services into multiple regions for *redundancy* and *locality*, or select a specific region to ensure you meet data-residency and compliance laws for your customers.
* **It's secure**: Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technical skills that can provide better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve.
