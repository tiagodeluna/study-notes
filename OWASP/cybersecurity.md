## Malware and Viruses

* **Malware**: malitious software used by criminals to infect devices and gain access to user's data. Some work quietly in the background, feeding information to a criminal, others allow external access to your computers. Some can prevent you accessing your files or devices (e.g keyloggers, spyware..)
* **Virus**: types of malware designed to keep spreading to other devices. The may delete files, search for passwords and other sensitive data, and send out spam emails.
* **Ransomware**: a type of malware that restricts access to a computer system or prevents it from operating properly. Typical attacks will demand a payment to be made to reclaim data or regain access to systems.

## Phishing

Phishing is a form of social engineering, designed to convince you to respond and reveal information. Scammers use authentic-looking, but fake, emails which may contain a link or attachment.

Different types of phishing:

* **Email spoofing**: sending email from a forget email address.
* **Vishing**: making phone calls pretending to be someone else, to trick victims into handing over sensitive info.
* **Smishing**: Delivery attacks by text message, often including a shortened URL
* **Pretexting**: setting up a fictional situation to gather more information, usually to inform a more sophisticated phishing attack.
